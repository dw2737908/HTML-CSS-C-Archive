/* First 3 table rules below should probably be left alone, but some values can be adjusted as needed. */

table#calendar { 
	width: 98%;             /* change this table width as needed  */
	margin-left: auto;      /* auto left and right margins centers the table since it has a width */
	margin-right: auto;   
	border-collapse: collapse; /* leave this alone unless you want the effect of cellspacing then change to "separate" */
	border-spacing: 0px;       /* leave this alone unless you want the effect of cellspacing then change to what you want */
}

table#calendar td, table#calendar th { 
	width: 14%;        /*  there are 7 days a week, so 7 * 14% = 98%, so leave this alone or tweak only slightly        */
	padding: 0;        /*  adjust as needed to get more spacing inside events table cells (the effect of "cellpadding") */
}

table#calendar td { 
	height:  4.75em;     /*  change this height for the calendar days as needed */
	vertical-align: top; /* keeps text vertically aligned to the top of the cell (default is center)     */

/* 1. Events Page Calendar Styles: Create 5 or more calendar table related rules. These should not affect other tables!    
   ==============================  5 required areas to style: table heading, weekdays, date #'s, empty days, & events.      
                                   You can style the table itself too. Consider using backgrounds on some of these areas. */

/* 2. FAQ Page Question & Answer Styles: Style questions differently from answers so questions are easier to find,    
   ====================================  question and answer pairs are grouped closer together vertically,          
                                         and as a result the whole section is more visually pleasing.               */

/* 3. Services Page Image Styles: Use each figures' id to float left/right & give margin on the inner side to keep text away.       
   =============================  Use images' class to give common border properties (use a border style other than "solid").   
                                  Also set common text styling for the figcaptions, perhaps including center aligning.       */

   ====================  Use only as needed. This section is optional and does not count for any points.    */
